## About the project:

For a long time there was an opinion that algorithms are not capable of creating works of art. Today, artificial intelligence technologies are gaining more and more popularity in the creative industries: with their help, they write music and texts, draw pictures. We want to invite you to go further and create a solution that can create a complex integral creative work by synchronizing the operation of various algorithms. To solve this problem, you will have to face generative (including multimodal) models, understand the features of their work and combine them into a single algorithm. Such solutions can greatly facilitate or even fully automate the laborious process of creating creative works and their visualization.
